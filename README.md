🌍 Top 5 emission-heavy industries (supply chain related):
Cement manufacturing: 3.8 kg CO₂e/USD
Beef cattle ranching: 2.8 kg CO₂e/USD
Cattle feedlots: 2.8 kg CO₂e/USD
Dual-purpose cattle: 2.8 kg CO₂e/USD

Dairy cattle: 1.7 kg CO₂e/USD
💰 Highest margin impact industry:
Abrasive Product Manufacturing with a 39.55% impact from GHG factors.
📉 Lowest (zero) margin impact industries include:
Advertising agencies
General management consulting
Air traffic control

📊 Margins by industry:
Maximum observed margin: ~13%
Average margin: ~1.69%

⚡ High-emission growth examples (drillthrough data):
Publishing industries: +122% increase in GHG factor.
Electronic component manufacturing: +110% increase.
Electrical equipment (e.g., refrigeration): +124% increase.

📌 Total summary:
The dashboard tracks ~1,016 NAICS codes.
Total margin impact from GHG factors: ~9,914% (aggregate across industries).
Average emission factor: 0.03–0.05 kg CO₂e per USD spent in many sectors.

✨ Fascinating takeaway:
Heavy industries like cement & cattle dominate supply chain emissions, while service-based industries (consulting, advertising) are nearly carbon invisible in direct terms. Yet, electronics and publishing show triple-digit increases in emissions intensity—hinting at hidden carbon hotspots in modern economies.
The dashboard presents greenhouse gas (GHG) emission factors linked to supply chain activities across industries, with a focus on margins, emission intensity, and industry comparisons.

1. Top Emission-Intensive Industries
Cement manufacturing, beef cattle ranching, cattle feedlots, dual-purpose cattle, and dairy cattle are among the highest contributors to GHG emissions.
These industries show significant emissions per unit of economic activity (kg CO₂e / USD).

2. Margin Impact
Certain industries have a high margin impact percentage, meaning emissions have a notable effect on profitability:
Abrasive Product Manufacturing (39.55% ↑)
Air & Gas Compressor Manufacturing (12.03% ↑)
Air-Conditioning & Refrigeration Equipment Manufacturing (17.95% ↑)
Many service-oriented industries (advertising, consulting, agencies) show 0% margin impact, indicating low direct GHG intensity.

4. Industry Distribution by Margin
Maximum margin observed: ~13%
Average margin: ~1.69%
Heavy industries like mining, chemicals, cement, and energy extraction dominate higher emission margins, while service sectors remain minimal contributors.
4. GHG Factors (Drillthrough Data)
The dashboard breaks down emissions at the NAICS code level (industry classification).
Units are expressed as kg CO₂e / 2022 USD (purchaser price), allowing comparability across industries.
Several industries show very high relative increases in emissions (over 100% in some cases), particularly in electronics, publishing, and chemical manufacturing.

5. Overall Insights
The supply chain GHG emissions are concentrated in resource-heavy and manufacturing industries.
Services sector cotributes negligible direct emissions but may still play a role through indirect supply chain dependencies.
The dashboard provides a quantitative base for identifying high-impact sectors where carbon reduction strategies could yield the most benefit.
